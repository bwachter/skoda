** Introduction
This repository contains models used in our Skoda Fabia 2014. Typically it'll work in many other cars built on the same VW platform.

** 3rd party reverse camera mount (LS8012)
Third party reverse cameras nowadays have clips supposed to grip just like the original door handle - but typically they're too small, and are not capable of properly securing the camera. Those modules also have screws - but they can't be fastened to anything in the car. Printing two of the nut supports in PETG allows properly mounting the camera using two washers and two locking nuts.
